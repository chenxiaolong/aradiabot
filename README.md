About
-----
Aradiabot is a full fledged IRC bot written entirely in Java, making her expandable and compatible with virtually every operating system. Aradiabot works similarly to [Bukkit](https://github.com/Bukkit/Bukkit) in regards to handling commands, plugins, etc., since many of her features and functions are based off it.

#####Major differences from PircBotX
* Fully functional CommandEvent and onCommand() methods
* Working Plugin API (still being improved)
* Utility libraries added for convenience (Validator, SQLite JDBC, etc)
* Aradiabot singleton object for easy referencing

#####Commands
This is a list of built in commands; all plugins should have their own commandlist.  
```$version, $plugins, $commands, $help, $alias, $shutdown, $source```

Plugin Example
--------------
Coming soon once the Plugin API is complete.
